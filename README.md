# Welcome to Restaurant Manage App

### What's the purpose ?
Restaurant Manage App is React App that visualize how to manage orders in Restaurant.


### Why I created this App ?
First version of this App was just an exercise to skill some libraries in React and to improve my React skills.
More time I spended on this exercises - more features I watnted to implement - and finally it get shape like little React project, rather than just exercise.

### Will it be release as commercial App for Restaurants ?
No. It's just a little project that is combination of simple exercises, imagination, some skills and a lot of fun. 
For now it can't be an App that stores sensitive datas like name, surname or address beacuse App "database" is just .json file. And that's not the safest way to store datas like that :)

# Usage & Installation 

## Installation üíø

1. Download project from Github repository. Check out link below to see the way to do it:

4. After this you can open another terminal window. Chceck if you are in correct place (you should be in project RestaurantApp). If you're not :
